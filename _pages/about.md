I'm a quantitative researcher at buy-side. My daily work covers machine learning modeling, alpha research, portfolio optimization. 

Previously, I got my Master degree in Financial Engineering from UC Berkeley. I completed a B.Sc. in Mathematics and B.A. in Economics from Wuhan University with outstanding student scholarship.
